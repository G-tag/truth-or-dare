      <h1>Don’t Break The Rules</h1>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Wherever you play the game, and whoever you play it with, make sure
            you follow the rules.
          </li>
          <li>One person in the group is asked “truth or dare?” by another.</li>
          <li>
            If they pick ‘truth’, the other player will ask a simple,
            embarrassing, or tricky question. They should answer it truthfully,
            without any fiction or omissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            If they pick “dare”, the other person will ask them to do something
            daring, and the player has to do it without hesitation.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the dare is too uncomfortable or embarrassing the player can ask
            for another.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once they tell the truth or do the dare, they can pick another
            player and ask them “truth or dare?”
          </li>
          <li>
            Remember that the objective of the game is to have fun and not
            humiliate anyone. After all, the people you would be playing the
            game with are your friends.
          </li>
